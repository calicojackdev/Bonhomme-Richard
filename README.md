# Bonhomme Richard
![Battle between Continental Ship Bonhomme Richard and HMS Serapis](https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/browse-by-topic/ships/ships-of-sail/bonhomme-richard/_jcr_content/body/media_asset/image.img.jpg/1650466768387.jpg)


_Bonhomme Richard_ was originally a French merchant ship, later converted to a warship in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War. This ship is of particular interest to me as it sits at the intersection of many engaging topics: 
- Sailed in the service of an early monopoly organization, the French East India Company
- Commanded by John Paul Jones, the renowned American naval commander
- Named for Benjamin Franklin's pseudonym, Poor Richard Saunders

The purpose of this project is to expose a job search service for the logistics industry that improves upon the experience of more generalized job boards.  

## Project Structure
This project consists of a set of `scrapers` that extract job information, `transformations` that clean/enhance the information, and an `api` that exposes the jobs.  

## Roadmap
- Better salary searching (eg salary buckets)
- Ranking results
- Add more ATS providers
- Timezone search (jobs in PT, MT, CT, ET)
- Add integration options (eg webhooks, snippets)
